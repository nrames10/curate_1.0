    <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of our project is to allow users to analyze their changing taste in music over time. Users can use this information to help shape their plans
        for what to listen to in the future. Moreover, we’re allowing our users to do this together with friends - as a pair or even a whole group.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Deliverables</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>User registration and profile</li>
        <li>Friends list and ability to view friend profiles</li>
        <li>Group accounts - up to 10 users</li>
        <li>Music entry functionality (Could be a song or album - user must enter name of entry, artist, year of release, and rating)</li>
        <li>Music release timeline (With variant of organized by date listened to)</li>
        <li>5-Star rating system</li>
        <li>Future listening log</li>
        <li>Suggestions (based on friend data)</li>
        <li>Visual data charts showing what artists / albums / songs you’ve listened to the most in a given timeframe (in a given week, month, or year)</li>
        <li>Rating leaderboard where all your music is ordered by your rating</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
