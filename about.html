			<h1>About Curate</h1>

			<p>		Our web application, Curate, is going to be a personal music curation tool. The app is not designed for listening; rather, for a user to keep their own database of music they have listened to and analyze that data with the features we provide.</p><br>
			<p>So how does Curate beat just going to your Spotify, or other music accounts, and seeing what you have liked? Our app aims to provide much more insightful analysis of your musical history by providing features that go beyond a binary like or dislike. These features include - Creating a visual release timeline for the music you enter, keeping a log of music you plan on listening to, allowing the user to rate their music, and various other forms of data visualizations that will allow the user to spot important trends in their listening history.</p><br>
			<p>Curate will also include social elements. This will allow for users to curate their music not only based on their own listening history, but on the history of their friends as well. See what others have been listening to lately, what their top-rated music is, or what they are planning on listening to soon. Users can even create group accounts in which they can keep track of their listening habits together. The app will offer listening suggestions based on your friendsâ€™ activity as well.</p>
