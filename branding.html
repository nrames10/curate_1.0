<h2>Color Choices</h2>
<p>Our overall theme for our overall website look is undecided and as a result we wanted to go with something neutral, so we chose a beige like color for our background. To contrast the background, we opted to make our header mint so that it would stand out. Another place where secondary color is used on our website is under "Our Team." When hovering over our team members, their profile picture displays color.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>Our font choice was serif which is reminescent of Times New Roman. The font sizing was used to emphasize what page is being displayed and where new content starts.</p>
